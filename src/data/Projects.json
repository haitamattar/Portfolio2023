In a team of two, we addressed this using sensors and a connectivity protocol, avoiding WiFi due to privacy concerns. I focused on connecting Lora and TTN (The Things Network), sending small data values. I also created a simple React Native mobile app for customers to monitor Co2, humidity, and temperature values, along with receiving notifications for maintenance requests initiated by Freek van Os.",

The application, built with Java (backend), Angular (front-end), and MySQL, streamlines this process. Using the RIVM (National Institute for Public Health and the Environment) data set for nutritional information, dietitians can now easily generate dietary intake for clients. I was mainly responsible for designing the database structure, developing DAOs (Data Access Objects), and creating the model and controllers in Java.",
