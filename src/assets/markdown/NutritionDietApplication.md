# Nutrition Diet Web Application

## About
LifeStyle Coaching Nederland needed a diet application for their dietitians.
Dietitians are creating a diet overview for their clients, but this was first done with paper, which takes too much time.
The application is built using Java (backend), Angular (front-end) and MySQL.
The application uses the existing [RIVM](https://www.rivm.nl/) (National Institute for Public Health and the Environment) data set, which contains all nutritional information.
The dietitian generates a dietary intake per customer through our application.
This process is now much easier because the application has a search function, which automatically gets the nutritional information of every meal.
All this can be printed in a clear total overview.

## Responsible For
I was responsible for designing the database structure and developing Data Access Objects (DAOs), as well as creating models and controllers in Java.
