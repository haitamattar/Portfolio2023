# DTAP Pipeline And A Social Media Site For Developers

## About
For a school project, we had to create a DTAP environment and an application that is maintained by the DTAP environment.
Programmers are often busy developing apps. As a result, some developers have little time to put together a decent portfolio.
SU User allows developers to import their GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket projects.
The application is made with Laravel and Vue.
The DTAP environment uses GitLab, Docker, and Laravel Envoy.

## Responsible For
I was mainly responsible for creating the DTAP environment.
Configuring Docker, integrating Docker with GitLab, Configuring Laravel envoy, front-end and I developed some web components.
