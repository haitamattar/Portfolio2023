To tackle this issue in our two-person team, we employed sensors and a connectivity protocol. Due to privacy concerns, we opted not to use WiFi. My specific role involved integrating Lora and TTN (The Things Network) to transmit data values. Additionally, I developed a straightforward React Native mobile application that enables customers to track CO2 levels, humidity, and temperature values. The app also provides notifications for maintenance requests initiated by Freek van Os.",
