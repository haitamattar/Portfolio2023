# Smart Ventilation System


## About
The company Freek van Os had a problem with regularly checking ventilation systems at homes and offices.
Most of the time the ventilation system didn't need maintenance.
Sensing when a system needs maintenance would save the time of employees and costs for the customer.
In a team of 2, we needed to solve this problem by using sensors and a connectivity protocol.
We couldn't use WiFi to send maintenance logs because of privacy reasons.

## Responsible For
I mainly worked on the connectivity between the Lora and TTN (The Things Network), which exist out of sending small data values to The Things Network.
And I made a simple React Native application (for mobile) where customers could check Co2, Humidity, and temperature values.
The application also notifies the user when a maintenance request is made by Freek van Os.
